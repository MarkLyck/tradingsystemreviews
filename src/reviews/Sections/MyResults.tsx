      A lot of you are probably wondering how much I made/lost using this system. I have now used Weekly Stocktip for
      2-3 months in a separate trading account.
    </p>
    <p>Here is a screenshot of my current Weekly Stocktip portfolio as of May 28th, 2020</p>
    <Image src="/static/weeklystocktip/current_portfolio.jpg" alt="current portfolio results" />
    <p>
      I invested in every signal Weekly Stocktip released (buy and sell), and all of them (so far) have been positive.
      But remember that the average holding period is longer than just two months, so I'm still holding onto these
      stocks and can't write it all off as "pure" profit just yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      I invested roughly $10,000 in total, by dollar-cost averaging parts of that into the system every week, and my
      total return on investment so far is <b>+61.78%</b>
    </p>
    <p>During my subscription so far, I received six sell signals:</p>
    <Image src="/static/weeklystocktip/sell_signals.jpg" alt="sell signals" />
    <p>
      I didn't get a chance to buy the following signals: APEI, WHG, PBF, & WSTG. The original BUY signal for these
      happened before I signed up. However, both FLR & GII, I was able to buy and sell at a profit within a few weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>
        I bought FLR at $8.12 and sold it for $14.11
        <br />I bought GII at $11.39 and sold it for $16.70
      </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      For one of them, I got a slightly worse deal than Weekly Stocktip, and the other got a slightly better deal. From
      what I've seen so far, the slippage is minimal, and you can buy and sell the stocks at similar prices than what
      they put out, and I wasn't on top of it either. I was probably at least an hour or two late trading these signals.
    </p>
    <p>All in all, the signals so far have been performing much better than expected. </p>
    <p>
      <b>Disclaimer: The entire stock market was bullish during the period of my review</b>. It's hard to know how much
      of my success to attribute to Weekly Stocktip vs. just the market in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      But given the company's transparency, you should be able to review their real-time performance and latest sell
      signals accurately for the time you are investing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will continue to use Weekly Stocktip in my small account and update this review with more long-term results once
      I've cycled through the portfolio.
