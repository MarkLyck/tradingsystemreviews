      <p>
        Weekly Stocktip is an <b>algorithmic trading system</b>. That means complex computer algorithms provide the BUY
        and SELL signals instead of a human investor. Algorithmic trading has many upsides since it doesn't make human
        mistakes or have to deal with human emotions, but only if done ethically. (we'll get into those pitfalls later)
      </p>
      <p>
        Weekly Stocktip uses a <b>value investment strategy</b>. The system analyzes all stocks in the current market
        from a pure business evaluation perspective as you'd expect any value investor to do.
      </p>
      <h3>What is value investing?</h3>
      <p>
        If you haven't heard of value or growth investing before, it is the same principles used by{' '}
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett" target="_blank">
          Warren Buffett
        </a>
        ,{' '}
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Graham" target="_blank">
          Benjamin Graham
        </a>
        , and many other top investors. Value investors only invest in stocks that are trading for cheaper than their
        "intrinsic or book value" (basically, what the company is worth).
      </p>
      <p>
        Investopedia has an excellent{' '}
        <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueinvesting.asp">article on value investing</a> if you want to
        learn more about this approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        What makes Weekly Stocktip unique is that they use algorithms instead of having a team of analysts. The
        algorithms use <b>all SEC filings, financial reports, and stock pricing history dating back to 1970</b> (or
        earliest possible date) to <b>evaluate all companies in the stock market at once</b>. Finding stocks selling for
        much cheaper than they should is not easy. So if Weekly Stocktip has done this right, analyzing every single
        stock all at once, provides a significant advantage in identifying which stocks are selling for cheaper than
        they should be.
      </p>
      <p>Weekly Stocktip has more than 114 unique algorithms to analyze these stocks based on these six factors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Risk</b> (estimated future risk)
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Reward</b> (expected future reward)
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Growth</b> (estimated future business growth)
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Profitability</b> (expected future profitability of the business)
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Soundness</b> (how sound is the business model)
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Stewardship</b> (how well does the company treat investors)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Weekly Stocktip says the system uses these factors to invest in high quality, profitable companies with good
        growth & low risk, that treat their investors well and only buy stocks with a large margin of safety.
      </p>
      <p>I was curious how much of this is Artificial Intelligence or machine learning. Here's what they said:</p>
      <Quote author="Weekly Stocktip">
        "The <b>AI part is not deeply integrated into the algorithms</b>. Instead, it's a thin layer that takes all the
        outputs of the algorithms and uses statistical probability to sum it all up to a more user-friendly score
        between -100 and +100, which is what we call the AI Score."
      </Quote>
      <p>
        I am glad to see the whole system isn't just a machine learning algorithm, but there's actual logic backing
        everything up.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are considering subscribing to Weekly Stocktip, I would recommend reading their{' '}
        <a href="https://weeklystocktip.com/static/2008_Whitepaper_weeklystocktip.pdf" target="_blank">
          2008 whitepaper
        </a>{' '}
        in detail. It goes a lot deeper into the strategy and how they avoided common pitfalls.
      </p>
      <p>
        Value investing is a <b>long proven strategy</b>. Combining that with an algorithmic trading approach that can
        identify bargains in the stock market is very promising. I'll give this strategy a big üëç (if it actually works)

      </TagsContainer>
      <p>Weekly Stocktip has a lot of statistics available, but I've collected the most important ones here:</p>
      <Statistics />
      <p>
        There's a lot to unpack there, but let's start with that +93.67% win ratio. According to this, on average, 9 out
        of 10 of the signals they suggested to buy was sold with a profit.
      </p>
      <p>
        The average return of those 9/10 signals have been +102.37%
        <br />
        The average loss of the 1/10 signals have been -16.47%
      </p>
      <p>
        So from that, we can calculate the expected return of a signal: (0.9367 * 102.37) - (0.0633 * 16.47) ={' '}
        <b>+94.85%</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you invested $100 in each of these, you would have $900 in winnings and only $17 in losses. That's a hugely
        disproportionate positive risk factor, and my first thought is, "
        <b>If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</b>" So let's analyze this a bit further.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over what period are these statistics recorded? Perhaps they chose an exceptional year to run their statistics.
        A typical red flag I often see in trading systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, after digging deeper, you'll find that these numbers are averages from 1970 to 2020. That means{' '}
        <b>the system has been through several market crashes</b> and all sorts of market situations unscathed. I cannot
        understate the importance of making sure that trading systems and their statistics are recorded over an
        acceptable period and not just during a bull run!
      </p>
      <p>
        But making sure the recorded statistics are over an acceptable period isn't enough to validate this either. The
        backtest could be flawed or straight-up fabricated. We'll get into that later in the review.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also looked at the numbers for the realtime results from their launch from 2009 to 2020. The numbers from this
        period were actually slightly better but still statistically close to the numbers from the full period (which is
        essential). Weekly Stocktip said:
      </p>
      <Quote author="Weekly Stocktip">
        "The statistics since our launch in 2009 are incorporated into the overall statistics. However, keep in mind
        that we haven't hit a major market crash since we launched, making the statistics look better than it should be
        in the long-term. The 1970-2020 statistics provide more accurate and realistic expectations as it has been
        through several recessions."
      </Quote>
      <p>
        So far, everything looks promising, but there's one more question you must ask when it comes to validating win
        ratios: whether they hold their losers indefinitely and never sell them? Everyone can get a +100% win ratio if
        they never sell the losers or only made a very few lucky trades!
      </p>
      <p>
        The Weekly Stocktip system executed +2,500 trades in the period from 1970 to 2020. I believe that there are
        enough trades to be statistically significant, but I still asked them specifically about holding stocks
        perpetually. Here's what they said:
      </p>
      <Quote author="Weekly Stocktip">
        "The system re-evaluates it's portfolio every week trying to figure out when it's time to sell each signal.
        There are several algorithms to trigger a sell for either a positive return or to limit a possible loss. There
        is also a hard deadline set at four years. This deadline is very rarely hit, but if it happens, it will sell the
        stock, no matter its price, to prevent holding onto stocks forever.
        <br />
        <br /> The average holding period since our 2009 launch has been 408 days."
      </Quote>
      <p>
        That satisfies my biggest concern about the statistics and brings the expected return in a more reasonable
        light. <b>The +94% average return is based on a holding period of +1 year</b>. But that's still a lot better
        than the 6-8% you'll get investing in an index fund.
      </p>
      <p>
        The holding period is on par with what you would expect from a long-term value investing system, so no surprises
        there.
      </p>

      <Image src="/static/weeklystocktip/backtested_chart.png" alt="backtested chart" />
      <p>
        Let's talk about those Max draw-downs. Max drawdown depicts the loss from the highest portfolio balance to the
        lowest portfolio balance. Looking at the chart above confirms that the portfolio dropped almost 50% in value
        from January 1973 to December 1974. This period is well known to be one of the worst stock-market crashes in
        history, and the S&P500 dropped over 50% in value as well during this period. I don't love that it lost that
        much, but at least there's a good explanation. I'm willing to give Weekly Stocktip a pass on this one,
        especially since they fully recovered from those losses in less than a year later. In comparison, it took the
        S&P500 about six years to recover from the crash.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like that they openly share such a high maximum all-time drawdown that happens over 50 years ago. It gives me
        some confidence in the legitimacy of their otherwise excellent numbers.

    <section data-type="backtesting">
      <h2>Backtesting</h2>
      <h4>
        We know Weekly Stocktip uses backtesting on their algorithms, but how ethical are they, and do they match
        real-world performance?
      </h4>
      <p>
        With any algorithmic trading system that utilizes a backtest, you have to make sure the conducting of the
        backtest is ethical.
      </p>
      <p>
        Luckily Weekly Stocktip is ahead of the curve and already has an in-depth article that goes above anything I
        could post about it here:{' '}

      <p>I highly encourage you to read this article in depth and make your own judgment.</p>
      <p>
        I am not too concerned about the backtesting methodology for Weekly Stoocktip because it's not a new company or
        strategy. They launched the system in 2009 and has a long-standing track record.

        Luckily since Weekly Stocktip isn't a new company and launched back in 2009 over 11 years ago, they already have
        an extensive track record we can review.
      </p>
      <Image src="/static/weeklystocktip/realtime_chart.png" alt="live performance chart" />
      <p>
        This chart shows how the portfolio developed from 2009 until June 2020 compared to the DJIA (Dow Jones
        Industrial Average), so if this is correct. <b>Weekly Stocktip earned a total accumulative return of +1,482%</b>
        . It might not be apparent that this is an accumulative return, which means it assumes you reinvest your profits
        into buying more stocks. In comparison investing your money in an index fund like the S&P500 or DJIA would only
        have netted about +217% return in the same period.
      </p>
      <Image size="large" src="/static/weeklystocktip/latest_sells.png" alt="latest sells" />
      <p>
        Weekly Stocktip publically provides a list of the latest ten sell signals, as shown above. After using the
        system for a few months now,{' '}
        <b>
          I can confirm that when they release a sell signal in the dashboard, they also update this list with the new
          sell signal and correct numbers.
        </b>{' '}
        They also claim to send out the sell signals, both positive & negative, to their newsletter, and sure enough,
        there was one negative signal during my subscription, and they made that one public as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Transparency is vital for trading systems, so I'm pleased to see{' '}
        <b>what you get in the dashboard match the marketing fluff on their website!</b> Usually, on the site, you see a
        few examples of "amazing" investments, and they never give out an expansive list of the latest trades.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll give Weekly Stocktip a 10/10 for transparency showing the latest signals, whether positive or negative.

        A lot of you are probably most interested in how much I made/lost using this system. I have now used Weekly
        Stocktip for X weeks in a separate trading account.

      <Image src="/static/weeklystocktip/current_portfolio.jpg" alt="current portfolio results" />
      <p>
        I invested in every signal Weekly Stocktip has put out with my own money, and{' '}
        <b>all of them have been positive</b>. But remember that the average holding period is quite long, so I'm still
        holding onto these stocks and can't write it all off to "pure" profit just yet.
      </p>
      <p>During my subscription so far, I have seen six sell signals:</p>
      <Image src="/static/weeklystocktip/sell_signals.jpg" alt="sell signals" />
      <p>
        APEI, WHG, PBF, & WSTG I didn't get a chance to buy because the BUY signals for these happened before I signed
        up. However, both FLR, GII, I was able to buy and sell at a profit within a few weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was able to buy and sell these stocks at comparable prices to the ones recommended, and more importantly, the
        signals don't seem to be the kind where you have to drop everything to be ready to trade at any time.

    <section data-type="risk">
      <h2>Risk</h2>
      <h4>
        Let's be real, any investment has some kind of risk involved, and Weekly Stocktip is not exempt from that
        despite their stellar performance.

      <p>
        We already know the Gain-to-Pain ratio, Sortino ratio, win ratio, and all these other statistics deem Weekly
        Stocktip as very low-risk investments overall. But what about periodically? How dependant is Weekly Stocktip on
        the performance of the market?
      </p>
      <p>
        To test this, I asked them to provide a chart where they overlayed the Weekly Stocktip performance chart with
        the DJIA chart from the same period on two different scales, and they look almost identical! The only difference
        is that Weekly Stocktip goes from 0% to +1,500% and DJIA goes from 0 to +250%. [Question mark]
      </p>
      <Image src="/static/weeklystocktip/ws_vs_djia.png" alt="Weekly Stocktip vs DJIA" />
      <p>So what gives? If Weekly Stocktip is so dependant on the market performance, how do they outperform it?</p>
      <p>
        It's all about the stocks they pick and the value/growth strategy they use. In general, when the stock market
        drops, all stocks drop (with some exceptions, of course), but some stocks drop less than the average.
      </p>
      <p>
        Likewise, when the stock market goes up in value, some stocks go up a lot more than the average. This is where
        Weekly Stocktip shines! When the market drops, their stock picks lose a bit of value too, but not as much as the
        market, and most importantly, when the market goes up, their stock picks go up A LOT more in value.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means if you invest in Weekly Stocktip signals in the longterm, assuming their performance stays the same
        in the future as it has in the past, <b>the returns are outstanding, and the risk is minimal.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        However, if you invest in Weekly Stocktip just before a market crash, you will most likely lose money in the
        short term! However, As far as I can tell, after any market crashes, they fully recovered from it within a year
        following the crash. I asked Weekly Stocktip about this, and they confirmed that the vast majority of their ~7%
        losing signals happened during market crashes, and in the past, the system would have quickly recovered.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to protect yourself from this risk, you should only invest in Weekly Stocktip if you think there
        won't be another market crash right around the corner, or if you are willing to stick with it for at least one
        to two years to recover all your losses in the event of a crash.
      </p>
      <p>
        As long as you don't panic-sell during a potential crash,{' '}

        Weekly Stocktip is about as simple as they come. They provide one BUY signal every Monday. The signal is visible

      </p>
      <Image src="/static/weeklystocktip/buy_signal.png" alt="Buy signal" />

        So how does this compare to other signal services? Well, the first thing I noticed is that there is no stop-loss
        and no target price. So I asked Weekly Stocktip about this, and they said:
      </p>
      <Quote author="Weekly Stocktip">
        "The system is fully dynamic. It re-evaluates its portfolio positions every week; thus, its target price and
        stop-loss also change weekly based on its financials.
        <br />
        <br />
        We have tried multiple implementations of implementing a hard stop-loss. But all of them have resulted in worse
        results than using the system's value investing approach. In short, the system is much better at judging the
        risk of holding a stock that has lost value than humans. If it can't say with a high enough statistical
        probability that this stock will go back up above 0, it will sell it before it hits rock bottom. However, if
        it's still a sound investment, it will keep it, and sure enough, they will most of the time go back up and sell
        at a profit. No hard stop-loss can do that. So we always recommend not setting a stop-loss and following the
        sell signals."

        These signals are straightforward to follow, especially for beginners, as their algorithms handle all the
        complexities of investing.

      <h4>Weekly Stocktip comes with a Stock Screening tool</h4>

        Taking an algorithmic approach to invest, one of the significant benefits is that they can evaluate every single
        stock in the market automatically. This is probably why their system is so profitable because they find value
        opportunities that most investors can't.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another benefit of this is that they have given every stock in the market what they call an "AI Score." A simple
        score between -100 to +100 (worst to best).
      </p>
      <p>
        With your membership to Weekly Stocktip, you get access to their "AI Reports," which is just a fancy word for
        their stock screener.
      </p>
      <p>
        The AI Reports allow you to use their algorithms to evaluate the stocks you currently own or other stocks you
        might want to invest in. I don't like to believe in stock screeners blindly, so let's put it to the test.
      </p>
      <p>
        I asked a friend who works as a professional value investor at a significant fund to evaluate two stocks from
        Weekly Stocktip, XXX, with an AI Score of -100 and YYY with an AI Score of +89. I didn't tell him anything about
        which one should be bad or good, and these are his findings:
      </p>
      <p>XXX:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Too much debt</li>
        <li>...</li>
      </ul>
      <p>YYY:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Large margin of safety</li>
        <li>Very profitable</li>
        <li>Not too much debt</li>
        <li>Good growth rate</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>This proves that the system evaluates companies based on real value investment principles.</b>

        I honestly don't like how cheap this is‚Äîgiven their track record and statistics. In my opinion, Weekly Stocktip
        could easily charge $25,000 a year for this system, and it would still be a bargain. If this system really
        works, why does it only cost $29 to get access?
      </p>
      <Quote author="Mark Lyck - Co-Founder of Weekly Stocktip">
        "Hello Michael,
        <br /> <br />
        You're entirely correct, Weekly Stocktip's $29 a week subscription doesn't cover our data costs. But it was
        never built to be hugely profitable. At our core, we're a money management company, and we provide private money
        management services, this is where we make the bulk of our profits.
        <br /> <br />
        We are planning to expand this section by creating a hedge fund with our value strategy. However, that is a
        massive undertaking that will likely take us years. So while we are building a hedge fund and making sure our
        algorithms can handle large AUM capital, we decided to provide access to our top signals for a very affordable
        price. In return, we get some publicity and good reviews. If we can help hundreds of people to accumulate more
        wealth for just $29/week and have hundreds of happy users when it comes to the funding round of hedge funds, we
        will already have a brilliant public record, and a lot of proof of our system working in realtime. We will be
        able to get the ball rolling sooner."
      </Quote>
      <p>
        Wow, A lot to unpack here! So that explains why they are willing to sell access to this for just $29, but it
        also raises the question of what will happen to Weekly Stocktip when they go public with a fund? Mark said this:
      </p>
      <Quote author="Weekly Stocktip">
        "If or when we open a hedge fund with the system, we will close Weekly Stocktip for new subscribers, existing
        subscribers will continue to have access to the system for at least one year after launch. All existing
        subscribers will also be given the opportunity to invest in the hedge fund at a better buy-in price."
      </Quote>
      <p>
        Yeah, I can see if they can build trust and wealth for their current subscribers. They are likely to provide
        equity for a fund later on. I'll give Weekly Stocktip a pass on the pricing being suspiciously cheap. üëç

      <p>
        Using Weekly Stocktip was very easy. After you sign up, you can immediately see the current signal, and you just
        follow it once a week. Technically you don't even have to log in to the platform if you don't want to.
        Everything you need to follow the system is in the SMS you'll receive when a new signal is available.
      </p>
      <p>
        My only negative comment about the user experience is that they are trying to do too much. All it needs to be is
        a message that says, e.g., "BUY XXX near $X.XX". But they added a lot of information and charts which might be
        useful if you want to do your own analysis on the tips. But #1, why would you sign up to Weekly Stocktip if
        you're not going to follow it? And #2, if you want to do your own analysis, you would probably go to Yahoo
        Finance or somewhere else with more data anyway.
      </p>
      <p>They do get bonus points for providing a quick link to Yahoo Finance, though!</p>
      <p>
        <b>It's straightforward to use and requires less than 10 minutes of work every week</b>. This is a big positive
        compared to a day or intra-day trading system!

        The Founder of Weekly Stocktip is Mark Lyck. Mark has a background in{' '}
        <b>business administration & economics as well as computer science</b>. The team was very knowledgeable about
        trading systems, the reward and potential risks involved.
      </p>
      <p>Weekly Stocktip started the work on their algorithms in late 2003.</p>
      <p>
        In 2009 - 2011, they ran their first beta test with outside investors. Since 2011 they have been using the
        system for private money management.
      </p>
      <p>In 2014 they first provided public access to the system as a signal service.</p>
      <p>
        The company is located in Denmark (home country of the Founder, so that makes sense). Weekly Stocktip is not
        registered with the SEC, but since they only provide signals on Weekly Stocktip and aren't managing your money
        directly, they don't have to register with the SEC.
